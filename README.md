## End-of-Term Project for the Algorithms and Data Structures II Course Based on the Game Rouba Montes, Played with a Deck of Cards
## Explanation:
  - The game is based on trying to have the largest pile among players. In each round, a card is drawn. If your card matches one on the discard pile, you stack both cards; if the card matches the top card of your pile, you stack it on top of your pile; if the card matches the top card of another player's pile, you steal their pile and stack the drawn card on top. The player with the largest pile at the end of the game wins.
## Features:
  1. Created in the C programming language;
  2. Use of data structures to represent game concepts (Stack for the draw pile and player piles, List for the discard pile, etc.);
  3. Option to choose the number of players using dynamic memory allocation, as well as the option to input names for each player;
